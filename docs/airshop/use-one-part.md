# Can I just use quoting or inventory?

Yes. AirShop modules work independently. You can use:

- **Quotes only** — Send and track quotes without inventory
- **Inventory only** — Manage stock without the quoting workflow
- **Both** — Full workflow with quotes linked to inventory items

Choose what fits your business. You can enable or focus on one module and add the other later.
